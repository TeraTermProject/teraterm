    <h3>Send size</h3>

    <p>
      Considering receiver's receive buffer size and processing speed,
      by inserting a delay for each specified send size,
      file send can be performed more efficiently than by inserting a delay for each character or each line.

      Dropping of transmitted data may occur at following part.

      <dd>
        It is unlikely to drop.<br>
        Data is sended while watching free size of send buffer.
      </dd>
      <dt>s2 Windows</dt>
      <dd>
        It is unlikely to drop.<br>
        Depending on hardware and driver version, various problems may occur, including BSoD.<br>
        You can see details of driver in Tera Term serial port settings.
      </dd>
      <dt>s3 transmission path</dt>
      <dd>
        In serial, there is no resend process with error. If error occurs in data, data is dropped.<br>
        For TCP/IP, pipe, it is unlikely to drop.
      </dd>
      <dt>s4 OS,UART chip(receiver)</dt>
      <dd>
        Receiving data beyond processing capacity of PC (CPU) (when PROGRAM does not pick up received data from OS or chip) or other causes,
        Receive buffer of OS (driver) or UART chip are overflows and data is dropped.<br>
        OS (driver) or program handles flow control depends on implementation.<br>
        In TCP/IP, flow control and resend on error are performed, and in most cases,
        protocol stack in OS handles these processes.<br>
        In serial, user can decide whether flow control is used or not, and resend are not automatically performed in case of overflow or other errors.
      </dd>
      <dt>program</dt>
      <dd>
        Dropped due to receive buffer overflow, etc. in program.<br>
        When receive buffer is about to overflow in pseudo terminal(pty), 0x07(BEL) is sent and Tera Term will ring bell.

    <p>
      If echo of sent data is not returned, it is possible that received data has been dropped somewhere.

	The Close button quits sending.

	The Pause button pauses sending. The Start button restarts sending.
	These buttons function as toggles.
