    <p>
      Sends a file to the host.

    <p>
      Selecting this menu brings up the "Send file" dialog.<br>
      Selecting this menu while holding down CTRL key skips "Send file" dialog
      and you can send file by only selecting file.<br>
      At this time, same sending options are used as before.

    <h3>Send size</h3>

    <p>
      Considering receiver's receive buffer size and processing speed,
      by inserting a delay for each specified send size,
      file send can be performed more efficiently than by inserting a delay for each character or each line.

      <dd>
        In serial, there is no resend process with error. If error occurs in data, data is dropped.<br>
        For TCP/IP, pipe, it is unlikely to drop.
      </dd>
      <dt>s4 OS,UART chip(receiver)</dt>
      <dd>
        Receiving data beyond processing capacity of PC (CPU) (when PROGRAM does not pick up received data from OS or chip) or other causes,
        Receive buffer of OS (driver) or UART chip are overflows and data is dropped.<br>
        OS (driver) or program handles flow control depends on implementation.<br>
        In TCP/IP, flow control and resend on error are performed, and in most cases,
        protocol stack in OS handles these processes.<br>
        In serial, user can decide whether flow control is used or not, and resend are not automatically performed in case of overflow or other errors.
      </dd>
      <dt>program</dt>
      <dd>
        Dropped due to receive buffer overflow, etc. in program.<br>
        When receive buffer is about to overflow in pseudo terminal(pty), 0x07(BEL) is sent and Tera Term will ring bell.
