    <p>
      Select the character width (number of cells) used by Tera Term to render text when using Unicode (UTF-8).<br>
      Specifying the character width expected by the remote host helps reduce display issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refer to <a href="setup-additional-font.html#ResizedFont">Drawing resized font to fit cell width</a> for Tera Term drawing character width.

    <h3 id="AmbiguousCharactersWidth">Ambiguous Characters width</h3>

    <p>
      Select 1 Cell or 2 Cell for the character width of characters with the Ambiguous East_Asian_Width property.<br>
    Refer to <a href="#EastAsianWidth">East_Asian_Width and width (cells)</a>.<br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="UnicodeEmojiOverride">Override Emoji Characters width</h3>

    <p>
      Sets the character width for characters whose Emoji property is set to Yes.<br>
      For details about this property, refer to <a href="../usage/unicode.html#emoji">About Emoji width (cells)</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When unchecked, the character width is determined based on the value of the East_Asian_Width property.<br>
      When the same width is applied regardless of the property value (W, N, or A).
    </p>

      <li>Emoji with U+1F000 and above are 2Cell (full-width).

      This check box is enabled if <a href="../setup/teraterm-term.html#OverrideCharWidth">Character width</a> setting is exists in TERATERM.INI file.
      When checked, User's character width setting is used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tera Term determines character widths according to Unicode specification.<br>
      If the remote host distinguishes character widths more finely than the
      "characters with a certain property" described above,
      this option allows you to flexibly configure character widths in Tera Term.<br>
      This can be used in following cases.
      Host's Unicode version differs from Tera Term, user want to uses own character width.
    </p>

    <h3 id="width_decision">Flow of character width determination</h3>

    <p>
      As described above, Tera Term provides multiple settings for specifying
      the character width used for rendering.
      The following diagram illustrates the priority order of these settings.
