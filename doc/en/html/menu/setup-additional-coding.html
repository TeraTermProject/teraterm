            a black dot will be drawn by OS.
            Depending on the version of OS, other character may be used.
          <li>Some OS versions automatically draw using other fonts.<br>
            This feature is called font linking.

    <h2>East_Asian_Width and width (cells)</h2>

    <p>
      Each characters are assigned East_Asian_Width property.
    </p>

    <p>
      5 types exsit, each types are defined character width.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there are two types of interpretation of character width
      <ol>
        <li>In an East Asian context</li>
        <li>in a non-East Asian context</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      The following table
    </p>

<pre>
cells(2=full/1=half)
|              | East Asian | non-East Asian |
| property     | context    | context        |
| F(Fullwidth) | 2          | 2              |
| H(Halfwidth) | 1          | 1              |
| W(Wide)      | 2          | 2              |
| Na(Narrow)   | 1          | 1              |
| A(Ambiguous) | 2          | 1              |
| N(Neutral)   | 1          | 1              |
</pre>

    <p>
      In a CJK environment, it is more natural to set the Ambiguous character width to 2Cell.<br>
      In addition, most Japanese fonts are designed in 2Cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neutral contains Emoji, that Emoji is unnatural in Japan when rendered in 1cell.
      Emoji's width can be changed to make them appear more natural.

      Attributes are determined based on the following data<br>

    <h2>About Emoji</h2>

    <p>
      Emoji property is other propery from East Asian Width property.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the CJK environment, as with the East_Asian_Width property,
      Characters that are not 1-byte in non-Unicode character codes, 2-cell is more natural.
    </p>

    <p>
      In non-CJK environments, many characters handling 1cell is natural, because 2cell characters did not exist in traditional character codes.
      Emoji with code points U+1F000 or higher that did not exist before Unicode, so they may be handled as 2-cell characters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following information is used to determine Emoji.<br>
      https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/12.1/emoji-data.txt<br>
      However, code points less than U+0080 are not treated as Emoji
