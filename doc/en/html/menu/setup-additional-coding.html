    <h2>Character width (cells)</h2>

    <p>
      Character width for <a href="../about/glossary.html#SBCS">single-byte character code</a> such as Latin-1 is 1 cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Character width for <a href="../about/glossary.html#DBCS">double-byte character code</a> such as Shift_JIS is 1 cell for 1-byte characters and 2 cells for 2-byte characters.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Unicode, character width of a single character changes case-by-case.
    </p>

    Example, "&#x00A7;" (section sign, section mark)
<pre>
| code               | character code(code point) | cell   |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| ISO8859-1(Latin-1) | 0xA7                       | 1      |
| Shift_JIS(CP932)   | 0x8198                     | 2      |
| KS5601(CP949)      | 0xA1D7                     | 2      |
| Big5(CP950)        | 0xA1B1                     | 2      |
| BG2312(CP936)      | 0xA1EC                     | 2      |
| Unicode            | 0xA7 (U+00A7)              | 1 or 2 |
</pre>

    <p>
      In a multibyte character code environment (<a href="../about/glossary.html#CJK">CJK</a>), character width should be 2 cell, and in other environments it should be 1 cell for natural use.
      Type of character whose width changes are called Ambiguous.

      Refer to <a href="#EastAsianWidth">East_Asian_Width and width (cells)</a> for detail.

          <li>Some OS versions automatically draw using other fonts.<br>
            This feature is called font linking.

    <p>
      5 types exsit, each types are defined character width.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there are two types of interpretation of character width
      <ol>
        <li>In an East Asian context</li>
        <li>in a non-East Asian context</li>

| N(Neutral)   | 1          | 1              |
</pre>

    <p>
      In <a href="../about/glossary.html#CJK">CJK</a> environment, it is more natural to set the Ambiguous character width to 2Cell.<br>
      In addition, most Japanese fonts are designed in 2Cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attributes are determined based on the following data<br>

    <h2 id="emoji">About Emoji width (cells)</h2>

    <p>
      Emoji property is other propery from East Asian Width property.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the CJK environment, as with the East_Asian_Width property,
      Characters that are 2 byte in DBCS, 2 cell is more natural.
    </p>

    <p>
      In non-CJK environments, many characters handling 1 cell is natural, because 2 cell characters did not exist in traditional character codes.
      Emoji with code points U+1F000 or higher that did not exist before Unicode, so they may be handled as 2 cell characters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following information is used to determine Emoji.<br>
      <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/emoji/emoji-data.txt" target="_blank">https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/emoji/emoji-data.txt</a><br>
      However, code points less than U+0080 are not treated as Emoji
    </p>

    <p>
      Neutral contains Emoji, that Emoji is unnatural in Japan when rendered in 1cell.
      Emoji's width can be changed to make them appear more natural.
