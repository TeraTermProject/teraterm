    <h1>XMODEM Receive ([File] Transfer menu)</h1>
    <p>
      Receives a file from the host with the XMODEM protocol. Activate
      the send command of the host's XMODEM before executing this command.
    </p>

    <h2>"XMODEM Receive" dialog box</h2>

    <h3>File Name</h3>
    <p>
      Enter the file name to be received.
    </p>

    <h3>Option</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Checksum/CRC</dt>
      <dd>
	Selects type of error detection(Checksum/CRC). <br />
	Packet size(1K) can be only specified at sender side.
      </dd>

      <dt>Binary</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Checked: Received data is treated as binary and saved in a file without modification.<br>
            The last received packet is packed with padding(EOF,$1A).
            For this reason, the end of file cannot be known when the end of the sent file is $1A.
          </li>
          <li>Unchecked: Received data is treated as text and saved in a file.<br>
            following processes are performed:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Newline code conversion<br>
                A single CR($0D) or LF($0A) is converted to CR+LF($0D+$0A).
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove padding(EOF,$0A) of each receiving packet<br>
                EOF($1A) does not appear in the text. So $1A at the end of the file will be removed.
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </dd>
