	      <div style="font-weight:bold;">When log file name is not a full path</div>
	      Tera Term scans value following order. If a value found, file name is understood as a relative path from that folder.
	      <ul>
	        <li><a href="#LogDefaultPath">Default log save folder</a></li>
	        <li><a href="../setup/folder.html#LogDir">Log folder</a></li>

        </div>
      </dd>

      <dt id="LogDefaultPath">Default log save folder</dt>
      <dd>
	Specify default Terminal log save folder.<br>
	Refer to <a href="../setup/folder.html#TermLogDir">Terminal log folder</a> for information where terminal logs are stored.<br>
	The current folder can be check in <a href="../menu/setup-directory.html">Setup Directory</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt id="LogAutoStart">Auto start logging</dt>
      <dd>
	Start logging automatically when connecting. Default Log File Name is used for log file name.<br>
	When the <a href="../commandline/teraterm.html#nolog">/nolog</a> command line is specified, this feature is always disabled.

      <dt id="LogRotate">Log Rotate</dt>
      <dd>
	The log rotation is enabled. The extension of the rotated file is added .1, .2, .3 etc.
	<dl>
	  <dt id="LogRotateSize">Size</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The log file is rotated when it grows bigger than Size bytes. If the size is followed by KB,
	    the size is assumed to be in kilobytes. If the MB is used, the size is in megabytes.
	  </dd>

	  <dt id="LogRotateStep">Rotate</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The log file is rotated Rotate times before being removed. If the Rotate is 0,
	    the old version is not removed rather than rotated.
