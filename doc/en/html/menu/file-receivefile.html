    <h1>Receive file ([File] menu)</h1>
    <p>
      Receive a file from the host.
    </p>

    <p>
      Selecting this menu brings up the "Receive file" dialog.<br>
      If you select this menu while holding down the CTRL key, it skips the "Receive File" dialog, allowing you to receive a file by simply selecting it.<br>
      At this time, the same receiving options as before will be used.
    <p>

    <p>
      This behavior can be changed with <a href="#SpecialOption">Special Option</a>.

        It will receive the contents of the file as is.<br>
        Text mode (character encoding, newline character conversion, suppression of control character output) is not implemented, so it is fixed to binary mode.
      </dd>

      <dt id="ReceivefileAutoStopWaitTime">Auto-stop wait time(sec)</dt>
      <dd>
        If there is no received data for the specified duration, the file reception will be terminated.<br>
        The default value for the wait time is 5 seconds.<br>
        If 0 seconds is specified, the file reception will not be terminated and will continue to wait for data.

    <h3 id="drop">Drop of received data</h3>
    When receiving data at a high bit rate from the serial port, there may be instances where received data is dropped.<br>
    This is likely to occur when the PC is under high load and Tera Term's processing (such as reading data from the UART chip, logging/file output, screen rendering, etc.) cannot keep up.
