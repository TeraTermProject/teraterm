    <h1>Receive file ([File] menu)</h1>
    <p>
      Outputs the data received from the host to a file.
    </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">
      Features
      <ol>
        <li>
          Can receive binary data and write it to a file even in environments where file transfer via scp, ftp, Kermit, etc. is not possible.<br>
          When receiving binary data from a UNIX server, run "stty raw" on the UNIX server.<br>
          For details, see the <a href="../macro/command/recvfile.html">recvfile macro command example</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Less prone to dropping received data during serial connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's faster to use "Receive file" than to output received data to the log.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Selecting this menu brings up the "Receive file" dialog.<br>
      If you select this menu while holding down the CTRL key, it skips the "Receive File" dialogand proceed to file selection.<br>
      In that case, the same receiving options as before will be used.
    <p>

    <p>
      This behavior can be changed in the configuration file.
      See "<a href="../setup/teraterm-trans.html#ReceivefileSkipOptionDialog">Skip Receive file dialog</a>" for details.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dialog">"Receive file" dialog box</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Filename (drop file in this dialog)</dt>
      <dd>
        Enter or select the output file name.<br>
        By dropping a file into dialog, You can enter the file name.
      </dd>

      <dt id="binary">Binary</dt>
      <dd>
        Write the received data to the file exactly as received.<br>
        No conversions are performed (kanji/codepage conversion, line-ending conversion, suppression of control-character output, etc.). Binary mode is fixed.
      </dd>

      <dt id="ReceivefileAutoStopWaitTime">Auto-stop wait time(sec)</dt>
      <dd>
        If there is no received data for the specified duration, the reception will terminate.<br>
        The default value for the wait time is 5 seconds.<br>
        If 0 seconds is specified, the receive process will not be terminated and will continue to wait for data.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>"Receiving file" dialog box</h2>
    <dl>

      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="drop">Drop of received data</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">
      When receiving data at a high bit rate from the serial port, there may be instances where received data is dropped.<br>
      This is likely to occur when the PC is under high load and Tera Term's processing cannot keep up.<br>
      Refer to the <a href="../usage/tips/data_drop.html#solution">Solution</a> section.
