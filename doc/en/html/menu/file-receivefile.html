    <h1>Receive file ([File] menu)</h1>
    <p>
      Writes data received from the host to a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Selecting this menu brings up the "Receive file" dialog.<br>
      If you select this menu while holding down the CTRL key, it skips the "Receive File" dialogand proceed to file selection.<br>
      In that case, the same receiving options as before will be used.
    <p>

    <p>
      This behavior can be changed in the configuration file.
      See "<a href="../setup/teraterm-trans.html#ReceivefileSkipOptionDialog">Skip Receive file dialog</a>" for details.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dialog">"Receive file" dialog box</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Filename (drop file in this dialog)</dt>

        Write the received data to the file exactly as received.<br>
        No conversions are performed (kanji/codepage conversion, line-ending conversion, suppression of control-character output, etc.). Binary mode is fixed.
      </dd>

      <dt id="ReceivefileAutoStopWaitTime">Auto-stop wait time(sec)</dt>
      <dd>
        If there is no received data for the specified duration, the file reception will be terminated.<br>
        The default value for the wait time is 5 seconds.<br>

    <h3 id="drop">Drop of received data</h3>
    When receiving data at a high bit rate from the serial port, there may be instances where received data is dropped.<br>
    This is likely to occur when the PC is under high load and Tera Term's processing (such as reading data from the UART chip, logging/file output, screen rendering, etc.) cannot keep up.<br>
    See <a href="file-sendfile.html#drop">"Send file" ([File] menu) Send size</a> for related information.
