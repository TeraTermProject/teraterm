        Please register a bug or a request to ticket. No account required.<br>
        In the case of a bug,
        If information that there is a problem with Tera Term is in ticket,
        we will fix it faster<br>
        example:
        <ul>
          <li>If you change a part of the environment, the behavior changes, etc.<br>
            The behavior of Tera Term and other terminal soft is different.<br>
            operating environments examples:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Windows</li>
              <li>Tera Term</li>
              <li>Serial, USB-Serial device, driver<br>
                (If a device made by compay A has no problem and a device made by compay B has a problem, you shoud contact Compay A support.<br>
                If devices are different but same chip is used, the same problem may exist.)</li>
              <li>Ethernet, driver<br>
                (If version X has no problem, but version Y has a problem, you shoud contact driver support.)</li>
              <li>communication path(cable(Ehter/Serial), hub, router, access point, providor, etc)</li>
              <li>destination(device, program(in server, device), OS, etc)</li>
            </ul>
          <li>reproducibility, frequency<br>
            It would be very helpful to know how to reproduce bug.</li>
          <li>log, screen capture</li>
          <li>text errors in help, website, etc</li>
        </ul>
        We can not response about something other than Tera Term or beyond volunteer work.<br>
        example:
        <ul>
          <li>Fix BSOD<br>
            Tera Term is a normal, Windows application program.
            It is very difficult to show BLUE SCREEN that appears on
            fatal error in Windows from normal program.<br>
            If normal program can stop Windows with BLUE SCREEN, there
            is a vulnerability in Windows.<br>

            In most cases, probably, the cause is in the device driver.</li>
          <li>network configuration, how to connect a host, host configuration, keyboard configuration</li>
          <li>how to write a macro file</li>
          <li>about specific devices and Windows<br>
            A device made by Compay A version X has problem, etc</li>
        </ul>
