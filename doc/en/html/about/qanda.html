<h2>[Basic usage]</h2>
<p>
<span class="qanda" id="connection">Q.</span> I can not connect to a host.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Please check the following things:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Network configuration of your PC. See Control Panel.</li>
 <li>Can you use other network applications such as WWW browsers and ftp  <li>clients?</li>
 <li>Is the host name or IP address correct?</li>
 <li>Can you connect to the host from other machines?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please read message and confirm following:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Invalid host</dt>
  <dd>
    Connection destination was not resolved from host name.<br>
    Confirm that host name is valid and host name is able to resolve.
  </dd>

  <dt>Connection refused</dt>
  <dd>
    Connection destination does not up a service.<br>
    Confirm service status.
  </dd>

  <dt>Connection timed out</dt>
  <dd>
    No response from destination.<br>
    Check network, host startup, firefall, etc.
  </dd>

  <dt>Network cannot be reached</dt>
  <dd>
    Unable to reach destination.<br>
    Check network adapter settings of PC on which Tera Term is running, or route to destination.
  </dd>

</dl>

<p>
Please ask the network administrator how to configure network properties.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Tera Term automatically closes when I logout a telnet host. How to disable closing?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Turn "Auto window close" off in the <a href="../menu/setup-additional-tcpip.html">[Setup] Additional settings "TCP/IP" tab</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> I want to connect to a telnet host, but a serial port is always opened when Tera Term is started.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Set "Default port" to "TCP/IP" in the <a href="../menu/setup-additional-tcpip.html">[Setup] Additional settings "TCP/IP" tab</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How do I connect to a host with dial-up TCP/IP (PPP)?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Before you run Tera Term, establish the PPP connection. In the case of Win 95, you should use "Dial-Up Networking".<br>
After the dial-up (PPP) connection is established, run Tera Term. Enter the host name or IP address at the <a href="../menu/file-new.html">[File] New connection</a> dialog box. If you don't know the name or IP address of the host, ask the network administrator.<br>
In the case of PPP connection, the serial port is controlled by the PPP connection utility. Serial port functions of Tera Term are for non-PPP connections and nothing to do with the PPP connection.
</p>

<p id="save_ini">
  <span class="qanda">Q.</span> I changed setup item, but it is not kept. Exit Tera Term and start Tera Term, changed setup item value is restored to original value.<br>
  <span class="qanda">A.</span> Tera Term does not save setup values automatically. To keep it, you have to explicitly save by <a href="../menu/setup-save.html">[Setup] Save setup</a>.
</p>


<h2>[Keyboard]</h2>
<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to set the Backspace or Delete key to work for the backspace function.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> For the Backspace key, turn "Backspace key" on or off in the <a href="../menu/setup-keyboard.html">[Setup] Keyboard</a> dialog box. For the Delete key, turn "Delete key" on (this may not work in some hosts).
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to use numeric keys in normal way?<br>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> I can not enter "/", "*", "-" and "+" by using the numeric keypad.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> See <a href="../usage/tips/about_tenkey.html">"Numeric keypad"</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to use F1-F4 keys as VT100 PF1-PF4 keys?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> See <a href="../usage/tips/pf1-pf4key_vt100.html">"PF1-PF4 keys of VT100"</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> F1 (or whatever) key does not work. How to configure the keyboard?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> In most cases, I can not answer this kind of question because I don't know how the key works. If you know what character (string) should be sent or what function should be performed by pressing the key, you can make the key work by editing the keyboard setup file. Read <a href="../setup/keyboard.html">Keyboard setup file</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to change the keyboard shortcut for the <a href="../menu/edit.html">[Edit] Paste (Copy)</a> command to Ctrl+V (Ctrl+C)?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> See <a href="../usage/tips/user-shortcutkey.html">"User shortcut keys"</a> and <a href="../setup/keyboard.html">"Keyboard setup file"</a>.
</p>


<h2>[SSH]</h2>
<p id="ssh_C-v">
  <span class="qanda">Q.</span> passphrase input box on SSH Authentication dialog can not paste by Ctrl+v key.<br>
  <span class="qanda">A.</span> Tera Term does not support paste by Ctrl+v key, because of support for input control character by "Ctrl+some key."<br>
  To paste passphrase, use Shift+Ins key.
</p>

<p id="ssh_SCP_dir">
  <span class="qanda">Q.</span> I sent a file by SCP without specifying destination folder, but file was not saved to shell current directory.<br>
  <span class="qanda">A.</span> SCP can not save to shell current directory.<br>
Terminal emulator does not know shell current directory of remote side. If prompt indicate current directory, a text from remote side is only displaying. Current directory is not shown always, in some shell or setting. User is able to understand current directory because he construct in his head from prompt text, result of `cmd' command or result of `cd' command.
</p>


<h2>[Miscellaneous]</h2>
<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> What is "Tera Term extension interface"?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> It is the interface between Tera Term and add-on modules. An add-on module is provided as a DLL which can hook Tera Term user interface functions, setup functions and Winsock functions. At the point of Mar 1998, no add-on module has been developed. Projects of developing add-on modules which support ssh and SSL are in progress. See Tera Term home page for currently available add-on modules.
</p>

<p id="dec_special_graphic">
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> DEC Special Graphics (like Box-drawing characters) ("Tera Special" font characters) are not displayed properly.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Refer to <a href="emulations_dec_special.html">DEC Special Graphics</a><br>
If "Tera Special" font does not display properly, reinstall it.<br>
Remove the "Tera Special" font from "Fonts" of Control Panel, restart the system and reinstall the "Tera Special" font manually at "Fonts" of Control Panel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> When Box-drawing characters in DEC Special Graphics ("Tera Special" font characters) are displayed, a "line" character does not match with an "angle" character smoothly.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Refer to <a href="emulations_dec_special.html">DEC Special Graphics</a><br>
When "Tera Special" font is used to display Box-drwing characters, the font is scaled to fit the size of normal character font. Depending on the scaling factor, this mismatch problem may occur. Please find a good choice of font and size for normal characters which does not cause this problem.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Why number of fonts in the list of <a href="../menu/setup-font.html">[Setup] Font</a> dialog box is so small?<br>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Why I can not select the "Times" font at the <a href="../menu/setup-font.html">[Setup] Font</a> dialog box?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Tera Term uses only fixed-pitch fonts such as "Terminal" and "Courier" because characters should be displayed with equal spacing in order to emulate the VT terminal properly. Displaying proportional font characters with equal spacing is in principle possible but it makes program complicated and slow. So Tera Term does not use proportional fonts.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span>On Windows7, the font dialog uses the current user's show/hide font settings to determine the font list to display. This will result in the display of fewer font lists in most instances. To disable font hiding, users should go to the Font Settings page in the Fonts CPL and no-select the "Hide fonts based on language settings" check-box.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to change the behavior of text selection by mouse double clicking?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> See <A HREF="../setup/teraterm-win.html#delimiter">"Delimiters of a word selected by double clicking"</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> The "at" command of Windows NT does not work for executing Tera Term.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Specify "/interactive" option for the "at" command.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> The window title can not change by using the <a href="../commandline/teraterm.html#w">/W=</a> of the command line option and the <a href="../macro/command/settitle.html">settitle</a> macro command.<br>

<span class="qanda">A.</span> Some Linux distributions overwrite the window title after the current users' changing. To prevent this behavior, try either one of the following two methods:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user configures the user's shell settings to disable sending the control sequence for the window title changing.</li>
  <li>A user turns off the "Accept Window Title Change Request" on the General tab of the <a href="../menu/setup-additional-general.html">[Setup]Additional Setting "General" tab</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="window_resize_clear">
  <span class="qanda">Q.</span> Window content is cleared when window is resized.<br>
  <span class="qanda">A.</span> To prevent this behavior, turn off <a href="../menu/setup-additional-general.html#ClearOnResize">[Setup]-[Additional settings]-[General]-[Clear display when window resized]</a>.
</p>

<p id="logfile_garbled">
  <span class="qanda">Q.</span> Content of log file is not same as displayed in VTWindow. Character that is not able to displayed is outputted.<br>
  <span class="qanda">A.</span> VTWindow displays result of received data which is parsed by control sequence. On the other hand, log file is a record of received data.<br>
  Therefore "content of log file" is not become same as "displayed content in VTWindow." It is similar to the difference between opening a Word document in Word and opening it in a text editor.

<p id="selected_highlight">
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> I selected a range, but it isn't highlighted. The color doesn't change.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span>
In the <a href="../menu/setup-additional-window.html">Window</a>, select "Reverse" for Attribute and click the "Swap colors" button.<br>
This occurs because the Normal attribute and Reverse attribute have the same color settings. When text with the Normal attribute is selected, <a href="./emulations.html#reverse">the colors of the Reverse attribute are applied</a>.<br>
The "Swap colors" button swaps the text and background colors of only the currently active character attribute. If you swap the Normal attribute colors, the Reverse attribute colors remain unchanged.

<h2>[About Tera Term 5]</h2>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Can the configuration file(TERATERM.INI) be shared with Tera Term 4?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span>
Tera Term 5 can read TERATERM.INI for Tera Term 4.

Tera Term 5 converts TERATERM.INI to UTF-16 with LE BOM(UTF-16LE BOM).

Tera Term 4 using the ANSI(not Unicode) API can also read/write
Unicode ini files because the OS converts the character encoding.

But, if the characters cannot be converted in ANSI/Unicode,
characters will be broken.

And, Windows 9x does not have a character code conversion function in API,
Unicode version ini files cannot be used.

Please also refer to the <a href="../reference/dev/win32api.html">API behavior</a>.
