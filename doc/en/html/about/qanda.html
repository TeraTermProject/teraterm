<h2>[Basic usage]</h2>
<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> I can not connect to a host.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Please check the following things:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Network configuration of your PC. See Control Panel.</li>
 <li>Can you use other network applications such as WWW browsers and ftp  <li>clients?</li>
 <li>Is the host name or IP address correct?</li>
 <li>Can you connect to the host from other machines?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please do not ask the author how to configure network properties. Please read books and magazines or ask the network administrator.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Tera Term automatically closes when I logout a telnet host. How to disable closing?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Turn "Auto window close" off in the <a href="../menu/setup-tcpip.html">[Setup] TCP/IP</a> dialog box.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> I want to connect to a telnet host, but a serial port is always opened when Tera Term is started.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Set "Default port" to "TCP/IP" in the <a href="../menu/setup-general.html">[Setup] General</a> dialog box.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How do I connect to a host with dial-up TCP/IP (PPP)?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Before you run Tera Term, establish the PPP connection. In the case of Win 95, you should use "Dial-Up Networking".<br>
After the dial-up (PPP) connection is established, run Tera Term. Enter the host name or IP address at the <a href="../menu/file-new.html">[File] New connection</a> dialog box. If you don't know the name or IP address of the host, ask the network administrator.<br>
In the case of PPP connection, the serial port is controlled by the PPP connection utility. Serial port functions of Tera Term are for non-PPP connections and nothing to do with the PPP connection.

<h2>[Keyboard]</h2>
<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to set the Backspace or Delete key to work for the backspace function.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> For the Backspace key, turn "Backspace key" on or off in the <a href="../menu/setup-keyboard.html">[Setup] Keyboard</a> dialog box. For the Delete key, turn "Delete key" on (this may not work in some hosts).

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> F1 (or whatever) key does not work. How to configure the keyboard?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> In most cases, I can not answer this kind of question because I don't know how the key works. If you know what character (string) should be sent or what function should be performed by pressing the key, you can make the key work by editing the keyboard setup file. Read <a href="../reference/keycode.txt">KEYCODE.TXT</a>.

<h2>[Miscellaneous]</h2>
<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> What is "Tera Term extension interface"?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> It is the interface between Tera Term and add-on modules. An add-on module is provided as a DLL which can hook Tera Term user interface functions, setup functions and Winsock functions. At the point of Mar 1998, no add-on module has been developed. Projects of developing add-on modules which support ssh and SSL are in progress. See Tera Term home page for currently available add-on modules.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Line drawing characters ("Tera Special" font characters) are not displayed properly.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Remove the "Tera Special" font from "Fonts" of Control Panel, restart the system and reinstall the "Tera Special" font manually at "Fonts" of Control Panel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> When line drawing characters are displayed, a "line" character does not match with an "angle" character smoothly.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Tera Term provides the original font "Tera Special" font to display line drawing characters. The font is scaled to fit the size of normal character font. Depending on the scaling factor, this mismatch problem may occur. Please find a good choice of font and size for normal characters which does not cause this problem.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Why number of fonts in the list of <a href="../setup-font.html">[Setup] Font</a> dialog box is so small?<br>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Why I can not select the "Times" font at the <a href="../setup-font.html">[Setup] Font</a> dialog box?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Tera Term uses only fixed-pitch fonts such as "Terminal" and "Courier" because characters should be displayed with equal spacing in order to emulate the VT terminal properly. Displaying proportional font characters with equal spacing is in principle possible but it makes program complicated and slow. So Tera Term does not use proportional fonts.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span>On Windows7, the font dialog uses the current user's show/hide font settings to determine the font list to display. This will result in the display of fewer font lists in most instances. To disable font hiding, users should go to the Font Settings page in the Fonts CPL and no-select the "Hide fonts based on language settings" check-box.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> How to change the behavior of text selection by mouse double clicking?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> See "Delimiters of a word selected by double clicking".
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> The "at" command of Windows NT does not work for executing Tera Term.<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span> Specify "/interactive" option for the "at" command.
</p>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> The window title can not change by using the <a href="../commandline/teraterm.html#w">/W=</a> of the command line option and the <a href="../macro/command/settitle.html">settitle</a> macro command.<br>

<span class="qanda">A.</span> Some Linux distributions overwrite the window title after the current users' changing. To prevent this behavior, try either one of the following two methods:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user configures the user's shell settings to disable sending the control sequence for the window title changing.</li>
  <li>A user turns off the "Accept Window Title Change Request" on the General tab of the <a href="../menu/setup-additional.html">[Setup]Additional Setting</a> dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h2>[About Tera Term 5]</h2>

<p>
<span class="qanda">Q.</span> Can the configuration file(TERATERM.INI) be shared with Tera Term 4?<br>
<span class="qanda">A.</span>
Tera Term 5 can read TERATERM.INI for Tera Term 4.

Tera Term 5 converts TERATERM.INI to UTF-16 with LE BOM(UTF-16LE BOM).

Tera Term 4 using the ANSI(not Unicode) API can also read/write
Unicode ini files because the OS converts the character encoding.

But, if the characters cannot be converted in ANSI/Unicode,
characters will be breaked.

And, Windows 9x does not have a character code conversion function in API,
Unicode version ini files cannot be used.

Please also refer to the <a href="../reference/dev/win32api.html">API behavior</a>.
