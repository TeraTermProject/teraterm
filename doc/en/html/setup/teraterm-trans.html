<h1 id="rename">Auto renaming of a received file to avoid overwriting</h1>

<p>
When a file is received by using the Kermit, Zmodem, BPlus or Quick-VAN protocol, the file name is given by the remote host. If the same file name already exists in the local disk, the existing file is overwritten by the received file. To avoid this overwriting, edit the AutoFileRename line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
AutoFileRename=on
</pre>

<p>
Then, the received file is renamed automatically to avoid overwriting. For example, if the received file is "abc.txt" and the same file name already exists in the local disk, the received file is renamed to be "abc1.txt".
</p>

<pre>
Default:
AutoFileRename=on
</pre>


<h1 id="bpauto">Auto activation of B-Plus Receive</h1>

<p>
To enable the auto activation of the B-Plus Receive command, edit the BPAuto line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
BPAuto=on
</pre>

<p>
If you run the B-Plus Send command in the host, the B-Plus Receive command of Tera Term is automatically activated.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
BPAuto=off
</pre>


<h1 id="bpesc">Escaping all control characters in the B-Plus protocol</h1>

<p>
To escape all control characters in the B-Plus file transfer, edit the BPEscCtl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following.
</p>

<pre>
BPEscCtl=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BPEscCtl=off
</pre>


<h1 id="bplog">B-Plus log</h1>

<p>
To log data packets of B-Plus to the file BPLUS.LOG, edit the BPLog line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
BPLog=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BPLog=off
</pre>


<h1 id="kmlog">Kermit log</h1>

<p>
To log data packets of Kermit to the file KERMIT.LOG, edit the KmtLog line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
KmtLog=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
KmtLog=off
</pre>


<h1 id="kmlongpkt">Kermit Long Packet</h1>

<p>
To transmit and receive extended-length packets of Kermit, edit the KmtLongPacket line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
KmtLongPacket=on
</pre>

<p>
However, the kermit server must support this feature.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
KmtLongPacket=off
</pre>


<h1 id="kmfileattr">Kermit File Attributes</h1>

<p>
To accept file attributes(size, type and timestamp, etc) of Kermit, edit the KmtFileAttr line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
KmtFileAttr=on
</pre>

<p>
However, the kermit server must support this feature.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
KmtFileAttr=off
</pre>


<h1 id="qvlog">Logging of Quick-VAN</h1>

<p>
To make the contents of the exchanged packets are recorded in the file QUICKVAN.LOG while transferring between the host and Tera Term using Quick-VAN, edit the QVLog line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
QVLog=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
QVLog=off
</pre>


<h1 id="qvwinsize">Window size of Quick-VAN</h1>

<p>
To set the parameter Window Size used in the Quick-VAN protocol, edit the QVWinSize line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
QVWinSize=&lt;window size (Decimal(positive))&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Possible window size values are from 1 to 99. In general, if the line is fast enough and error-free, the larger the window size, the faster the transfer rate. However, if a slow or error-prone line is used, or if the host or PC is not able to retrieve data, too large a window size will adversely affect the transfer rate.
</p>

<p>
The window size value actually used is the smaller of the Tera Term setting and the host (PC-VAN) setting. Therefore, if the Tera Term setting value is set larger than a certain value, the transfer rate will not change any more.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
QVWinSize=8
</pre>

<h1 id="xmlog">XMODEM log</h1>

<p>
To log data packets of XMODEM to the file XMODEM.LOG, edit the XmodemLog line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:

</pre>

<pre>
Default:
XmodemLog=off
</pre>


<h1 id="xmodemrecv">Receive command for XMODEM</h1>

<p>
You can automatically start the receipt of file by sending "a command for XMODEM receipt" to host immediately before transmitting a file. Specify a command for XMODEM receipt to be sent from Tera Term.
</p>

<pre>
XmodemRcvCommand=rx
</pre>

<p>

</p>

<pre>
default:
XmodemRcvCommand=
</pre>


<h1 id="XmodemTimeouts">Timeout settings for XMODEM</h1>

</pre>


<h1 id="zmauto">Auto activation of ZMODEM Receive / Send</h1>

<p>
To enable the auto activation of the ZMODEM Receive / Send command, edit the ZmodemAuto line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
ZmodemAuto=on
</pre>

<p>
If you run the ZMODEM Send command at the host, the ZMODEM Receive command of Tera Term is automatically activated. <br>
When ZMODEM receiving(upload) command of remote host is executed, the file selection dialog of ZMODEM sending is opened.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
ZmodemAuto=off
</pre>


<h1 id="zmparam">Parameters for ZMODEM sending</h1>

<p>
You can change the ZMODEM parameters for sending by editing the ZmodemDataLen and ZmodemWinSize lines in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
ZmodemDataLen=&lt;data sub packet length in bytes&gt;
ZmodemWinSize=&lt;window size for sending in bytes&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that these parameters does not affect ZMODEM receiving.
</p>

<p>
The maximum data sub packet length is 1024. Usually the larger packet length causes the faster sending speed.
</p>

<p>
The maximum window size is 32767. Usually the larger window size causes the faster sending speed. If you want to set the window size to infinity, specify a minus value (e.g. -1).
</p>

<p>
If the communication line has problems in the flow control or error correction, or the data processing power of the host is extremely low, decreasing the packet length or window size may improve speed and stability of file sending.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
ZmodemDataLen=1024
ZmodemWinSize=32767
</pre>

<p>
NOTICE:
Please specify the ZmodemDataLen=128 at the Allied Telesis router.
</p>

<pre>
Condition:
Serial connection
Binary flag on
Not Bracketed Paste Mode 
Telnet flag off
LocalEcho off
