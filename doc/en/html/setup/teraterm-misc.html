<h1 id="ClickableUrlBrowser">A browser by using Clickable URL</h1>

<p>
When the clickable URL is enabled, the default browser will be launched.<br>
If a user can specify the browser and the argument, change the ClickableUrlBrowser and the ClickableUrlBrowserArg entries at [Tera Term] section in the following:
</p>

<pre>
ClickableUrlBrowser=firefox

</pre>


<h1 id="JoinSplitURL">URL string concatenated of split line</h1>

<p>
When the end of URL string continues to the next line, basically the whole string is recognized as a URL string.
However, when the carriage return is inserted into the URL string by the end of a line, the whole string
can not work well.<br>
The URL string split by a carriage return can work well to configure the JoinSplitURL entry of the
[Tera Term] section in the teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
JoinSplitURL=on
</pre>

<p>
By using the emacs editor, a special character will be displayed at the end of the line when
the line continues to next line. If this character is recognized with a part of URL string,
the whole string can not work well with the URL format. <br>
So, Tera Term can ignore the special character to configure the JoinSplitURLIgnoreEOLChar entry
of the [Tera Term] section in the teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
JoinSplitURLIgnoreEOLChar=
</pre>

<p>
Also, the emacs editor can change the special character to other character.<br>
When the character is changed, a user configures the JoinSplitURLIgnoreEOLChar entry
of the [Tera Term] section in the following:
</p>

<pre>
JoinSplitURLIgnoreEOLChar=|
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
JoinSplitURL=off
JoinSplitURLIgnoreEOLChar=\
</pre>


<h1 id="LogLockExclusive">Exclusive-lock log file</h1>

<p>
When a log file is opened in written mode, the file will be locked exclusively. So, the log file can not be opened by multiple processes.<br>
When this option is disabled, a user can open a log file while Tera Term is opening the file.
</p>

<pre>
LogLockExclusive=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
LogLockExclusive=on
</pre>


<h1 id="DeferredLogWriteMode">Deferred log write mode</h1>

<p>
The log file is written on the thread procedure to avoid Tera Term slows down
when the log file is recorded on the network drive.
</p>

<pre>
DeferredLogWriteMode=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
DeferredLogWriteMode=on
</pre>


<h1 id="LogTimestampFormat">Specify timestamp format at the start of log file's line</h1>

<p>
When the log file is written, the timestamp can be added at the start of line and the timestamp format can be specified.
</p>

<pre>
SYNOPSIS:
%a      Abbreviated weekday name
%b      Abbreviated month name
%d      Day of month as decimal number (01 - 31)
%e      Day of month as decimal number ( 1 - 31)
%H      Hour in 24-hour format (00 - 23)

</pre>

<pre>
Example:
; Sun Jun  4 21:12:40.123 2017
LogTimestampFormat=%a %b %e %H:%M:%S.%N %Y
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
; 2017-06-04 21:12:40.123
LogTimestampFormat=%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N
</pre>


<h1 id="LogTimestampUTC">UTC is used as timestamp at the start of log file's line</h1>

<p>
When the log file is written, the timestamp can be added at the start of log file's line. Basically, local time is used. <br>
When local time is used for summer time, the clock will go or back at summer time switching. So, unexpected clock will be recorded. <br>
Fortunately, this problem can be avoided because UTC timestamp does not support summer time. <br>
If UTC timestamp is used instead of local time, change the LogTimestampUTC entry of [Tera Term] section in the following:
</p>

<pre>
LogTimestampUTC=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
LogTimestampUTC=off
</pre>

<h1 id="HighDPI">High DPI Aware</h1>

<p>
The High DPI feature is supported.
Tera Term works as the Per-monitor DPI Aware application.
</p>

<p>
Tera Term works as the DPI Unaware application when "DPIAware=off" entry is added to [Tera Term] section in teraterm.ini.
</p>

<p>
Scaling results become smooth at High DPI when you choose a TrueType font for the <a href="../menu/setup-font.html">Font</a>.
</p>
<p>
High DPI aware has some modes. For more reference, see the DPI AwarenessMode section on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/hidpi/high-dpi-desktop-application-development-on-windows#dpi-awareness-mode" target="_blank">High DPI Desktop Application Development on Windows DPI AwarenessMode</a>.
</p>
<p>
Tera Term is using the Per-monitor DPI awareness V2 feature that is supported on the Windows 10 Version 1703 or later. For more details of the Per-monitor DPI awareness V2, see the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/04/high-dpi-scaling-improvements-desktop-applications-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank"> High-DPI Scaling Improvements for Desktop Applications in the Windows 10 Creators Update (1703)</a>.
</p>

<h1 id="IniAutoBackup">Auto backup of Tera Term setup file</h1>

<p>
When overwriting an existing setup file, a backup file is created automatically.
If you do not need a backup file, change the IniAutoBackup entry of [Tera Term] section as the following:
</p>

<pre>
IniAutoBackup=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
IniAutoBackup=on
</pre>

<h1 id="BracketedSupport">Supports bracketed paste</h1>

<p>
If you do not need <a href="../about/glossary.html#Bracketed">Bracketed paste</a>, change the BracketedSupport entry of [Tera Term] section as the following:
</p>

<pre>
BracketedSupport=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BracketedSupport=on
</pre>

<h1 id="BracketedControlOnly">Limit bracketed pasting to cases containing control characters</h1>
<p>
<a href="../about/glossary.html#Bracketed">Bracket pasting</a> is useful because it allows the pasted content to be confirmed before fixateing it,
but it requires two steps of pasting and fixating even if the pasted content does not include control characters such as line changings.
If you want to enable bracket pasting only when control characters are included, change the BracketedControlOnly entry of [Tera Term] section as the following:
</p>

<pre>
BracketedControlOnly=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BracketedControlOnly=off
</pre>
