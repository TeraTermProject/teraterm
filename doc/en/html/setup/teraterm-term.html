<BODY>

<h1 id="backwrap">Back wrap</h1>

<p>
If you enables the back wrap, the cursor at the beginning of a line moves back to the end of previous line when a BS character is received. To enable the back wrap, edit the BackWrap line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
BackWrap=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BackWrap=off
</pre>


<h1 id="beep">The motion receiving BEL character</h1>

<p>
Tera Term will sound the beep when the BEL character(ASCII $07) receives.
</p>

<p>
You can disable the beep sound for the BEL character by editing the Beep line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Beep=off
</pre>

<p>
Also, the terminal screen will flush instead of sounding the beep in the following configuration.
</p>

<pre>
Beep=visual
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Beep=on
</pre>


<h1 id="C1">Disabling the C1 (ASCII $80-$9F) control characters</h1>

<p>
If you choose the Terminal ID to be "VT2XX" or "VT3XX" in the [Setup] Terminal dialog box, characters in range of ASCII $80-$9F are interpreted as the C1 control characters.
</p>

<p>
You can disable this interpretation and make these characters visible on the screen (if you are using a font which supports these characters), by editing the Accept8BitCtrl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Accept8BitCtrl=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Accept8BitCtrl=on
</pre>

<h1 id="C1send">Send C1 (ASCII $80-$9F) control characters</h1>

<p>
When sending C1 control characters, Tera Term uses equivalent 7-bit sequences.
</p>

<p>
To send C1 control characters as single 8-bit characters, edit the Send8BitCtrl line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Send8BitCtrl=on
</pre>

<p>
Note: This setting is used only as default setting. Host can change this setting by S7C1T / S8C1T / DECSCL control sequence.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
Send8BitCtrl=off
</pre>

<h1 id="kout">Enable incorrect "kanji-out"</h1>

<p>
The "kanji-out" sequence ^[(H used in some systems does not comply with JIS/ISO standards. Do not use it unless it is really necessary. Bay default, ^[(H can not be selected in the [Setup] terminal dialog box to prevent mistakes.
</p>

<p>
To select ^[(H as "kanji-out" sequence, edit the AllowWrongSequence line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
AllowWrongSequence=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
AllowWrongSequence=off
</pre>


<h1 id="kctrl">Invalidate first character of a 2-byte character(Kanji) when a control character is placed between the first and second bytes</h1>

<p>
Even if a control character (e.g. line feed character) is placed between the first and second bytes of a 2-byte character (Kanji) sent from the host, both the 2-byte character and the control character will be handled correctly by Tera Term's default settings.
</p>

<p>
To invalidate the first character of a 2-byte character(Kanji) when a control character is placed between the first and second bytes, edit the CtrlInKanji line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
CtrlInKanji=off
</pre>

<p>
If a second byte comes after this, it will be shown as garbage. For applications that do not handle 2-byte characters correctly, this may result in fewer garbled screen characters. For example, if there is an application that produces a newline character after the first byte of a Kanji character, but not the second byte after it, the Kanji character will be discarded, but the characters that come after the newline character will not be garbled.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
CtrlInKanji=on
</pre>

<h1 id="displayall">Displaying all received characters</h1>

<p>
To display all received characters (including control characters) on the screen, edit the Debug line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
Debug=on
</pre>

<p>
If you press Shift+Esc, Tera Term enters the debug mode, in which all received characters are displayed on the screen. 
The debug mode have four pattern, a user can switch from output as usual to disable output completely.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>output as usual -&gt; usual teraterm debug mode  -&gt; hex output -&gt; disable output completely</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you select the output as usual in the debug mode, Tera Term returns to the normal mode.
</p>

<p>
In the debug mode, received characters are displayed by the following way:
</p>

<pre>
ASCII code of the character    Displaying form
$00 - $1F                      ^@ - ^_
                               ($00=^@ $01=^A $02=^B $03=^C $04=^D $05=^E $06=^F $07=^G 
                                $08=^H $09=^I $0A=^J $0B=^K $0C=^L $0D=^M $0E=^N $0F=^O 
                                $10=^P $11=^Q $12=^R $13=^S $14=^T $15=^U $16=^V $17=^W 
                                $18=^X $19=^Y $1A=^Z $1B=^[ $1C=^\ $1D=^] $1E=^^ $1F=^_)
$20 - $7E                      normal character
$7F                            &lt;DEL&gt;
$80 - $FF                      MSB of the ASCII code is turned to be 0 and displayed by
                               the same way as one for $00-$7F characters,
                               except that text is displayed in the reversed color.
</pre>

<p>
In the hex output mode, received characters are displayed by the following way:
</p>

<pre>
ASCII code of the character    Displaying form
$00 - $FF                      hex format(capital letters) separated by a space
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
Debug=off
</pre>


<h1 id="statusline">Disabling the status line</h1>

<p>
To disable the status line functions of VT terminal, edit the EnableStatusLine line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
EnableStatusLine=off
</pre>

<p>
Then, escape sequences for the status line functions are ignored.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
EnableStatusLine=on
</pre>


<h1 id="tekgin">Mouse code in TEK GIN report</h1>

<p>
In TEK GIN mode, the cross hair cursor appears in the TEK window. When you press a key or click the left mouse button, the key code (ASCII code) is sent with the coordinate of the cursor.
</p>

<p>
You can change the key code for the left mouse button by editing the TEKGINMouseCode line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
TEKGINMouseCode=&lt;key code&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
TEKGINMouseCode=32
(ASCII code 32 corresponds to the space character.)
</pre>


<h1 id="vttab">Displaying tab at end of line like VT terminal</h1>

<p>
If you set 'on', the behavior of tab at end-of-line is the same as VT/PuTTY/xterm. The tab doesn't cause automatic linefeed.<br>
If you set 'off', the behavior of tab at end-of-line is the same as FreeBSD console(syscons). The tab causes automatic linefeed. (it is not compatible with VT)
</p>

<pre>
VTCompatTab=on
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
VTCompatTab=off
</pre>


<h1 id="ScrollWindowClearScreen">Scroll down the current buffer when the screen is clear</h1>

<p>
&lt;ESC&gt;[J (Erase Below) escape sequence equals &lt;ESC&gt;[2J (Erase All) when the current cursor is top left (0, 0).<br>
A user can configure whether the current buffer scrolls down when the screen is clear.
</p>

<p>
If this configuration value is on, the current buffer will scroll down as well as &lt;ESC&gt;[2J escape sequence.<br>
If this configuration value is off, the current buffer will not scroll down. Instead, some buffers from the cursor position to the end of the screen.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
ScrollWindowClearScreen=on
</pre>


<h1 id="UnicodeDecSpMapping">Mapping of Unicode to DEC special character</h1>

</pre>


<h1 id="StrictKeyMapping">Mapping of the function key</h1>

<p>
A use can change the default action of the function key and the editor keypad from Tera Term 4.62. When a user can use this feature, the key sequence like as the VT terminal sends to the server without the keyboard configuration file.
</p>

<p>
If a user disables the function key action in the keyboard configuration file and sends nothing to the server, please change the StrictKeyMapping entry in teraterm.ini file in the following:
</p>

<pre>
StrictKeyMapping=on
</pre>

<pre>
The default value:
StrictKeyMapping=off
</pre>


<h1 id="Meta8Bit">MSB set character sending with Alt key</h1>

<p>
To send MSB(Most Significant Bit) set character by using the Alt key, a user should modify Meta8Bit line of [Tera Term] section in a configuration file as follows
</p>

<pre>
Meta8Bit=raw
</pre>

<p>
To send MSB(Most Significant Bit) set character by using the Alt key with a conversion to transmission character code (e.g. UTF-8), a user should modify Meta8Bit line of [Tera Term] section in a configuration file as follows
</p>

<pre>
Meta8Bit=text
</pre>

<p>
Also, the user should enable the <a href="../menu/setup-keyboard.html">Meta Key</a> setting.
</p>

<pre>
default:
Meta8Bit=off
</pre>


<h1 id="AltScr">Disabling the alternate screen buffer</h1>

<p>
Tera Term 4.65 later version supports for the alternate screen buffer. An old screen is restored when the application such as Vim and less exits.
</p>

<p>
To disable the alternate screen buffer functions, edit the AlternateScreenBuffer line in the [Tera Term] section of the setup file like the following:
</p>

<pre>
AlternateScreenBuffer=off
</pre>

<pre>
default:
AlternateScreenBuffer=on
</pre>


<h1 id="TerminalUID">Configure Terminal Unique ID</h1>

<p>
When the Tera Term receives the DA3 control sequence, the Tera Term replies the terminal unique ID. The ID is 8-digit hex value, the first 2-digit is the manufacture place and the remaining 6-digit is the unique number in the place.
</p>

<p>
If a user changes the ID to the 01234567, configure the TerminalUID entry in the teraterm.ini file as follows:
</p>

<pre>
TerminalUID=01234567
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
TerminalUID=FFFFFFFF
</pre>


<h1 id="LockTUID">Changing Terminal Unique ID</h1>

<p>
Basically, the terminal unique ID can be changed by receiving the DECSTUI control sequence. However, this feature is disabled.
</p>

<p>
When the feature is enabled, describe the LockTUID entry in the [Tera Term] section as follows:
</p>

<pre>
LockTUID=off
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
LockTUID=on
</pre>


<h1 id="TabStopModify">Disabling tabstop modification</h1>

<p>
When the tabstop position can not be able to modify by the control sequence, configure below TabStopModifySequence entry in the [Tera Term] section of the teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
TabStopModifySequence=off
</pre>

<p>
Also, some control sequences can not be able to do. <strong>Enabling</strong> sequences of the tabstop control sequence are as follows:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Mnemonic</th> <th>Sequence</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>HTS7</td> <td>ESC H</td>     <td>Enables the tabstop at the cursor position(7bit form).</td></tr>
<tr><td>HTS8</td> <td>0x88</td>      <td>Enables the tabstop at the cursor position(8bit form).</td></tr>
<tr><td>HTS</td>  <td> - </td>       <td>Both HTS7 and HTS8.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TBC0</td> <td>ESC [ 0 g</td> <td>Disabling the tabstop at the cursor position.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TBC3</td> <td>ESC [ 3 g</td> <td>Disabling all tabstop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TBC</td>  <td> - </td>       <td>Both TBC0 and TBC3.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
For example, when 8bit-form tabstop sequence(HTS8) is disabled, configure below TabStopModifySequence entry in the [Tera Term] section of the teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
TabStopModifySequence=HTS7,TBC
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
TabStopModifySequence=on
</pre>


<h1 id="BellLimitting">Limited BELL Over</h1>
<p>
When the BEL character(ASCII $07) is sent from the host server, Tera Term will generate a beep sound and blink a screen.
</p>

<p>
When a user shows the binary file by mistake and many BEL characters are sent, much beep sound can suppress automatically.<br>
For example, when the BeepOverUsedTime, BeepOverUsedCount and BeepSuppressTime are below configured, the beep sound will be suppressed for ten seconds after five BEL characters are sent for two seconds.
</p>

<pre>
BeepOverUsedTime=2
BeepOverUsedCount=5
BeepSuppressTime=10
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
BeepOverUsedTime=2
BeepOverUsedCount=5
BeepSuppressTime=5
</pre>


<h1 id="MaxOSCBufferSize">OSC string buffer size</h1>
<p>
Tera Term will expand the buffer size of the OSC string when the buffer size is lack. 
However, when the remote host sends invalid OSC string by using the host bug, 
Tera Term will restrict the buffer size to prevent enlarged memory allocation.
</p>
                                                                                                                                                        <p>
When the OSC 52 (PASTE64) is used for burst data, the remote host data may be
abandoned by above restriction. <br>
So, a user can configure the OSC buffer size in the MaxOSCBufferSize entry of the
teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
MaxOSCBufferSize=16000
</pre>

<pre>
Default:
MaxOSCBufferSize=4096
</pre>

<h1 id="ISO2022ShiftFunction">Disabling ISO/IEC 2022 shift function</h1>

<p>
When character set switching by ISO/IEC 2022 shift is forbidden, please configure below setting on ISO2022ShiftFunction entry of [Tera Term] section in the teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
ISO2022ShiftFunction=off
</pre>

<p>
Also, specific entry can be disabled into ISO/IEC 2022 shift function. Please specify <strong>accepted</strong> function name's combination into below shift function.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Mnemonic</th> <th>Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>SI</td>   <td>0x0F</td>  <td>Maps G0 character set into GL.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SO</td>   <td>0x0E</td>  <td>Maps G1 character set into GL.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
For example, when Shift-In(SI) and Shift-Out(SO) is disabled, please configure below setting on the ISO2022ShiftFunction entry of [Tera Term] section in the teraterm.ini file.
</p>

<pre>
ISO2022ShiftFunction=LS2,LS3,LS1R,LS2R,LS3R,SS2,SS3
</pre>

<p>
Also, when '-' is added in the front of name, specified shift function can be disabled. The above Shift-In(SI) and Shift-Out(SO) is disabled to configure below setting.
</p>

<pre>
ISO2022ShiftFunction=ALL,-SI,-SO
</pre>

<p>
NOTE: When this format is specified, using function is replaced after configure saving.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
ISO2022ShiftFunction=on
</pre>


<h1 id="FIXEDJIS">Use as 7-bit JIS KATAKANA (dedicated) terminal</h1>

<p>In the following configuration:
  <ul>
    <li>General Settings/Language: Japanese</li>
    <li>Terminal/Kanji Receive: JIS</li>
    <li>Terminal/Kanji Receive/Half-Width Kana: On</li>
  </ul>
In Japanese mode, by default, G1 is designated to JIS X 0201 half-width katakana.
If using JIS X 0201 half-width katakana with 7-bit encoding, G1 is invoked to GL using SO to use it.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you execute the following, it will display as "ﾃﾗﾀｰﾑ".
</p>
<pre>
echo -e '\016CW@0Q\017'
# => ﾃﾗﾀｰﾑ
</pre>

<p>
However, when G1 is designated another character set, JIS X 0201 half-width katakana is not displayed using SO.
</p>

<pre>
# G1 is designated US-ASCII.
echo -e '\033)B'

# Even when G1 is invoked to GL using SO, JIS X 0201 half-width katakana cannot be displayed.
echo -e '\016CW@0Q\017'
# => CW@0Q
</pre>

<p>
When FixedJIS=on, G1 is invoked to GL using SO, G1 is designated JIS X 0201 half-width katakana. So JIS X 0201 katakana is always displayed.
</p>

<p>
"FixedJIS=on" is a setting to lock G1 to JIS X 0201 half-width katakana. This allows the terminal is always a 7-bit JIS katakana terminal.
</p>

<pre>
Default:
FixedJIS=off
</pre>

<h1 id="FallbackToCP932">Decode invalid UTF-8 characters as CP932</h1>

<p>
Decode invalid UTF-8 characters as CP932. This is an experimental implementation.
