* What to do when new macro command is added?

- Coding
-- get a new number of command internal ID.
   ... teraterm/ttmacro/ttmparse.h
-- add a if statement to below function.
   ... CheckReservedWord@teraterm/ttmacro/ttmparse.c
-- add a caller doing the macro command.
   ... ExecCmnd@teraterm/ttmacro/ttl.c
-- make a function code for the macro command.

- Help topic
-- make the command help file.
   ... doc/LANG/html/macro/command/hogefunc.html
-- add the file to help topic.
   ... doc/LANG/teraterm.hhc
-- get a new number of context ID in help page.
   The value is internal ID + 92000.
   ... teraterm/common/helpid.h
-- make the alias between context ID and calling file.
   ... doc/LANG/teraterm.hhp

  * On VS2008 Express Edition, following error occurs:
      .\ttxssh.rc(10) : fatal error RC1015: cannot open include file 'afxres.h'.

    To avoid this error, edit ttxssh.rc file. Delete the line of "afxres.h", and add 2 lines.

      - #include "afxres.h"
      + #include <windows.h>
      + #define IDC_STATIC -1

    Visual Studio
      http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/vstudio/downloads/default.aspx
    Inno Setup
      http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
    Oniguruma
      http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/
    OpenSSL
      http://www.openssl.org/
    zlib
      http://www.zlib.net/
    PuTTY
      http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
    CygTerm
      http://www.dd.iij4u.or.jp/~nsym/cygwin/cygterm/
    LogMeTT
      http://www.logmett.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=5

  2. Increase the software version and modify date.
     Increment the version of VS_VERSION_INFO while release process.
     - ttermpro.rc
     - ttxssh.rc
     - ttmacro.rc // only modifying
     - ttpmenu.rc // only modifying
     - TTProxy.rc // only modifying
     - ttxkanjimenu.rc // only modifying
     - teraterm.iss
     - html/about/hisotry.html

       Note: Don't update the version number until the release, because the installer does not overwrite file when versions are same.

       Note: By way of exception, CygTerm+ always upgrades not regarding Tera Term release process when the patch is committed. The release date is the day committed by a developer. The suffix of CygTerm+ version is patchlevel, and then a user can get gcc compiler for free.

  3. Create SVN tag.
       The naming rule is `teraterm-version'(ex. teraterm-4_62).

  4. Re-checkout from svn tag.

  5. Evaluate executable program file.
       - Rebuild Tera Term program
       - Make installer package
         Open "teraterm\installer\teraterm.iss" with ISTool and call [Project]-[Compile Setup] with InnoSetup.
       - Test Tera Term installation and evaluate it.

  6. Update SourceForge.jp project site.

  7. Update SourceForge.jp project home page.

  8. Announce release to mailing list(in Japan).

  9. Announce release to forum(in Canada).
