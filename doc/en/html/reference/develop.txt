* What to do when new macro command is added?

- Coding
-- get a new number of command internal ID.
   ... teraterm/ttmacro/ttmparse.h
-- add a if statement to below function.
   ... CheckReservedWord@teraterm/ttmacro/ttmparse.c
-- add a caller doing the macro command.
   ... ExecCmnd@teraterm/ttmacro/ttl.c
-- make a function code for the macro command.

- Help topic
-- make the command help file.
   ... doc/LANG/html/macro/command/hogefunc.html
-- add the file to help topic.
   ... doc/LANG/teraterm.hhc
-- get a new number of context ID in help page.
   The value is internal ID + 92000.
   ... teraterm/common/helpid.h
-- make the alias between context ID and calling file.
   Open the .hhp file by using Text Editor, added a html line in [ALIAS] tag.
   ... doc/LANG/teraterm.hhp

* How to release Tera Term installation package
  To release Tera Term installation package is shown in the following step:

  0. Increment the version while RC release process.
     - teraterm\common\tt-version.h
     - ttssh2\ttxssh\ttxssh-version.h
     - ttpmenu.rc // only modifying
     - TTProxy.rc // only modifying
     - ttxkanjimenu.rc // only modifying
     - teraterm.iss
       version up AppVer and add "RC"
       comment out snapshot
       change called batch files

  1. Check latest libraries and tools.
     Visual Studio
       http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/vstudio/downloads/default.aspx
     Inno Setup
       http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
     Oniguruma
       https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma
     OpenSSL
       http://www.openssl.org/
     zlib

     LogMeTT
       http://logmett.com/logmett-freeware
       http://logmett.com/ttleditor

  2. Check the document files.

  3. Increase the software version and modify date.
     - teraterm.iss
       remove "RC" from AppVer
     - html/about/hisotry.html

     Note: Don't update the version number until the release, because the installer does not overwrite file when versions are same.

     Note: By way of exception, CygTerm+ always upgrades not regarding Tera Term release process when the patch is committed. The release date is the day committed by a developer. The suffix of CygTerm+ version is patchlevel, and then a user can get gcc compiler for free.

  4. Evaluate executable program file.
     - Make installer package
       Open "teraterm\installer\teraterm.iss" with ISTool and call [Project]-[Compile Setup] with InnoSetup.
     - Test Tera Term installation and evaluate it.

  5. Create SVN tag.
     The naming rule is `teraterm-version'(ex. teraterm-4_82).
     svn copy -m "Release 4.82" svn+ssh://svn.osdn.net/svnroot/ttssh2/trunk svn+ssh://svn.osdn.net/svnroot/ttssh2/tags/teraterm-4_82

  6. Re-checkout from svn tag.

  7. Make installer package
     Open "teraterm\installer\teraterm.iss" with ISTool and call [Project]-[Compile Setup] with InnoSetup.

  8. Update OSDN project site.
     - Add new release.
     - Submit news.

  9. Announce release to mailing list(in Japan).

  10. Update OSDN project home page.

  11. Delete snapshots.

  12. Announce release to forum(in Canada).
      - Announcements http://logmett.com/support-forums/5
        Create new topic in `Announcements' entry.
        Change the type of previous Announcement from Announcement to Normal.
        Delete third previous Announcement.

  13. Announce release to Twitter.
      https://twitter.com/Tera_Term
      Post release announcement and pin.

  14. Update Chocolatey
