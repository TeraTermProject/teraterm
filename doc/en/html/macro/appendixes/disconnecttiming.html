<h1>NOTICE: Immediately re-connect the server after disconnection</h1>
<p>
When a user immediately connects to the server after disconnection, a problem will occurs. Refer to below code.
</p>

<pre class="macro-example">
; Sending the exit command to disconnect the remote host.
sendln "exit"

; Re-connect the remote host.
connect "server"
</pre>

<p>
This macro script will do not work in most cases.<br>

When a user sends the exit command, it will take a few minutes to disconnect the server. So, a time lag will occur.<br>
If a user uses the connect command while the time lag occurs, the connect command will become successful because the local host still connects to the remote host.<br>
</p>

<p>
To fix this problem, use the connect command after finish the disconnection. See below code.
</p>

<pre class="macro-example">
; Sends the exit command and prompts the server disconnection.
sendln "exit"

do
	; Waits 10 msec.
	mpause 10
	; Confirms the connection status.
	testlink
; Repeats if TeraTerm connects the server. See <a href="../command/testlink.html">result is 2</a>.
loop while result = 2

; Re-connects a new connection.
connect "server"
</pre>

<p>
Also, when <a href="../../menu/setup-tcpip.html#autowinclose">Auto window close</a> configuration is enabled, a user uses the unlink command. Refer to in the following code:
</p>

<pre class="macro-example">
; Sends the exit command and prompts the server disconnection.
sendln "exit"

; Unlinks TeraTerm.
unlink

; Re-connects a new connection.
connect "server"
</pre>

</body>
