<h1>Encoding</h1>

<p>
The Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE) can be supported from Tera Term 4.102.
</p>

<p>
The TTL file was processed as ANSI CodePage in previous version.

<h2>2) Encoding determination</h2>

<p>
Tera Term determines the encoding as follows.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>When BOM exists</dt>
  <dd>Tera Term determines one of UTF-8, UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE from BOM type, next reading the file.</dd>

  <dt>When BOM does not exist</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading the file as UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Reading the file as CP_ACP (same as before 4.102) when the file can not be decoded as UTF-8.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
