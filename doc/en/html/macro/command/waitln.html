<h1>waitln</h1>

<p>
Waits a line that contains string.
</p>

<pre class="macro-syntax">
waitln &lt;string1&gt; [&lt;string2&gt; ...]
</pre>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>
Pauses until a line which contains one of the character strings is received from the host, or until the timeout occurs. Maximum number of the strings is 10.
</p>

<p>
If the system variable "timeout" or "mtimeout" is greater than zero, the timeout occurs when &lt;timeout&gt;.&lt;mtimeout&gt; seconds have passed. If the timeout is less than or equal to zero, the timeout never occurs.
</p>

<p>
These commands return the received line in the system variable "inputstr" and one of the following values in the system variable "result":
</p>

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Timeout.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>A line which contains &lt;string1&gt; has received.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>A line which contains &lt;string2&gt; has received.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>n</td>
  <td>A line which contains &lt;stringn&gt; has received. n=1..10.</td>
 </tr>
